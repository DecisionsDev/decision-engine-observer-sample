Introduction<a name="intro"></a>
============

This document provides an example implementation of a 
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.7.0/com.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.ref.designer/html/api/html/com/ibm/rules/engine/observer/Observable.html">Rule Engine Observer</a>. The code is provided and can be extended as needed. An Observer is used to receive notifications from an Observable object (You can use it for additional logging for instance).

You can import this sample into an existing Rule Designer or Decision Center to View.

Version(s) Supported<a name="versions"></a>
====================

IBM ODM 8.7 or greater

Usage Instructions<a name="instruction"></a>
===================

1. Import into decision center (or rule designer).
2. Update the deployment configuration to include your RES Server. 
3. Deploy to the RES server.
4. Log onto the RES server and navaigate to the ruleapp "MyTest" in the explorer tab. Open up ruleset "runRules". 
5. Retreive HTDS description file, select REST, format WADL, and Test.
6. Click on "Execute Request"; you will see trace messages in the response printed by our observer.

============

Inside the Main Rule Project (TestObserverForOoC-service):

<u>Rules:</u>

This project has a few sample rules (rule "RuleA", and decision table "RuleB"). These are filler rules, just created so that there are rules to run in the ruleflow.

Functions ("initialize" and "finalize"):

The function "initialize" creates a new response object, calls the BOM method add with the created response as the parameter.
The function "finalize" calls the BOM method remove to remove the observer, and print the messages it has stored.

Ruleflow ("Main flow"):

This calls the function "initialize" at the start, then runs the rules, and finally calls the function "finalize" during cleanup.

Variables:

The variables "request" and "response" are instantiations of the BOM objects.

BOM:

In the BOM, we have verbalizations of the request and response objects. We also have an Observer class which is not verbalized (so that it is not seen by business users). Observer has two BOM method's defined; "add(Response)" and "remove()". Add takes a Response object, and creates/adds a new EngineObserverDE with a new trace. Remove gets the list of observers that have been added to the engine, searches for any with the class "EngineObserverDE", and removes them.

Deployment:

There is a decision operation "TestObserverOperation", which defines that a request is required for input, and a response is given on output. There is also a deployment configuration which defines the target RES server.

Inside the XOM project (TestObserverForOoC-xom):

Response/Request Classes:

The Request object contains a date, and an input number. The response object contains an outout number, a string message, and stores the EngineTrace.

TraceElement:

This is esentially a wrapper for a String message. An EngineTrace contains a list of TraceElement messages that were created when the observer was sent a notification by the engine.

EngineTrace:

This class contains/stores a list of TraceElements. There are also some boolean variables that can be turned off to turn off parts of the observer trace (traceRules, traceRuleFlows, traceAgenda). We added an xml wrapper so it behaves properly in htds. When the observer is notified of something by the engine, a TraceElement with a message is added to this EngineTrace.

EngineObserverDE:

This class implements three children of Observer; <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.7.0/com.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.ref.designer/html/jrules2dotnet/html/T_IBM_Rules_RVE_RuleDef_Runtime_RuleEngineObserver.htm">RuleEngineObserver</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.7.0/com.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.ref.designer/html/jrules2dotnet/html/T_IBM_Rules_RVE_Ruleflow_Runtime_RuleflowObserver.htm">RuleflowObserver</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.7.0/com.ibm.odm.dserver.rules.ref.designer/html/jrules2dotnet/html/T_IBM_Rules_RVE_RuleDef_Runtime_AgendaObserver.htm">AgendaObserver</a>. It overrides the reuired methods for these interfaces and adds to its trace whenever one of these is called during a notification event. 
It uses an EngineTrace Object to store all the notification traces, and this object is printed when the observer is removed.
